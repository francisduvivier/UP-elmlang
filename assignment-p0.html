<h1 id="project-assignment-functional-reactive-programming-elm">Project Assignment Functional Reactive Programming (Elm)</h1>
<p>For this assignment, you are required to implement a version of the Asteroids game in Elm.</p>
<p>An example implementation can be found on <a href="http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/dominique.devriese/Elm/Asteroids.html">this page</a>.
 Your solution should mimic the behaviour of this implementation. If 
something is not clear in this assignment, you can consider the example 
implementation as part of the instructions.</p>
<h2 id="expected-working-time">Expected working time</h2>
<p>We expect you to spend max. 20 hours on this assignment. You are 
allowed to turn in an incomplete assignment. If you do, try to implement
 features that are explained early on in the assignment first. If you 
are quickly ready, there are some optional extra assignments you can 
make.</p>
<h2 id="debug-output">Debug output</h2>
<p>We recommend you use a debugging text element to make information available for debugging, as demonstrated in the Elm demo.</p>
<p>You can do this with code like the following:</p>
<pre><code>    game : Signal Element
    game = ...  -- The actual game Element

    -- debugInfo : Signal ...
    debugInfo = ... -- Whatever info you want to show for debugging

    debugEl : Signal Element
    debugEl = lift asText debugInfo

    -- FULL GUI
    main : Signal Element
    main = lift2 above game debugEl</code></pre>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>We require you to implement the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The playing field.</p>
<p>There is a playing field of 500x500 pixels, with a black background color.</p></li>
<li><p>Game play</p>
<p>Initially, a new game is started by pressing space. If the player 
wins or loses, the field disappears and the text "Won" or "Lost" is 
shown until the player presses space to start the next game etc.</p>
<p>The game must run using a fixed heartbeat of 20 Hz, meaning that user
 input is read roughly 20 times per second and objects move forward at 
their current speed 20 times per second.</p></li>
<li><p>Space ship</p>
<p>The player controls a little space ship flying around in the playing field.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drawing</p>
<p>To draw the space ship at a certain position <code>(x,y)</code> and orientation <code>dir</code>, you are required to use the following code. This will draw the space ship as an arrow in that direction.</p>
<pre><code>    showPlane : (Float, Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Form
    showPlane pos orientation =
      move pos (rotate orientation  
        (filled white (polygon [(10,0),(-8,-5),(-4,0),(-8,5)])))</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Steering</p>
<p>The space ship has a certain position, speed and orientation. Without
 user input, it retains its previous speed and orientation. The user 
controls the ship using the arrows. Pressing Up/Down increases/decreases
 the speed slightly, pressing Left/Right makes the ship turn about its 
axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Playing field edges</p>
<p>If the space ship hits the edge of the playing field, it bounces back. This means that if its orientation was previously <code>dir</code> and it hits a vertical edge (the right or left edge of the field), its new orientation becomes <code>pi - dir</code>. If it hits a horizontal edge (the upper or lower edge), then the new orientation becomes <code>-dir</code>. It must not be possible for the ship to leave the playing field.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Asteroids</p>
<p>Asteroids fly around in the playing field. These have a fixed speed 
and bounce against the edges in the same way as the space ship. 
Different asteroids can have different diameters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drawing:</p>
<p>You are required to draw the asteroids with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>    showAsteroid : (Float, Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Form
    showAsteroid pos diam = move pos (filled white (ngon 5 diam))</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Collisions</p>
<p>If the space ship collides with an asteroid, the game is lost. To 
determine if a collision takes place, you can treat the asteroids as if 
they were circle-shaped. For collision detection, the space ship can be 
treated as an 8-pixel radius circular object.</p>
<p>Asteroides cannot collide with each other. They just "fly through each other".</p></li>
<li><p>At the start</p>
<p>At the start of a game, at least five asteroids appear with different
 size, position, speed and orientation. These initial values may be 
chosen fixed and hardcoded in the program source.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding asteroids</p>
<p>It should be easy to change the source code to add additional 
asteroids or change their initial parameters. This must be possible by 
changing only the initial state of the game and none of the other code.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Bullets</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firing bullets</p>
<p>The player can fire bullets by pressing the space bar. When he does 
so, a bullet appears whose orientation is the same as that of the space 
ship, speed is 4 pixels/time-unit larger than that of the space ship. 
Their initial position should be at the space ship's front tip.</p>
<p>One bullet can be fired per time-unit.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing bullets</p>
<p>You should draw bullets as circles with a diameter of 1 pixel.</p></li>
<li><p>At the field's edge</p>
<p>If a bullet reaches the field's edge, it disappears. You must make 
sure that when they do, their data is not still being kept and updated 
in the game's internal memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Bullet hitting an asteroid</p>
<p>When a bullet hits an asteroid, <em>both</em> the bullet and the 
asteroid disappear from the game. Here too, you are allowed to treat 
asteroids as circular objects for collision detection.</p>
<p>Bullets cannot hit other bullets or the space ship, they just "fly through each other".</p></li>
<li><p>Winning the game</p>
<p>The player wins the game when all asteroids are destroyed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Optional extra features</p>
<p>If you have extra time, you can implement some extra features. These are not implemented in the example assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Change the way bullets are fired, so that only one bullet can be 
fired per second while other user input is still processed and objects 
still move at 20Hz.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Elm's Random package to choose a (pseudo-)random number of asteroids, with random initial speeds, orientations etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Make asteroids bounce against each other as well. Figure out how their orientations should change after such a bounce.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the game more interesting by adding levels of increasing 
difficulty or by recording and showing the current playing time and 
keeping the quickest winner per level as a high-score etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="practically">Practically</h2>
<p>You can implement and test your implementation using the online editor that we make available at <a href="http://193.190.168.58:8000/try">this location</a>. We ask that you do not use the one on elm-lang.org to spare the Elm team's server resources.</p>
<p>We emphasize strongly that <strong><em>THE ONLINE EDITOR WILL NOT SAVE YOUR CODE</em></strong>. Therefore: while making this assignment, remember to <strong><em>SAVE YOUR CODE OFTEN</em></strong>
 in a safe location. You can do this for example by selecting all your 
code in the editor, copy/pasting it into a normal editor and saving to a
 suitable file.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>Here are some links with documentation material for Elm:</p>
